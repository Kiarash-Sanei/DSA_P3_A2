# Tree Degree Checker

This program analyzes a tree data structure to find a valid root node where all nodes at the same distance from the root have the same degree (number of neighbors).

## Problem Description

Given an undirected tree with N nodes (numbered from 1 to N), the program finds a root node such that:

- All nodes at the same distance from the root have the same degree (number of connected edges)
- If multiple valid root nodes exist, the program returns the smallest one
- If no valid root exists, the program returns -1
